## ✅ Pre-Production Security Checklist

Before using any generated config in production, verify:

### Secrets Management
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in any file
- [ ] Secrets stored in Vault / AWS SSM / GitHub Secrets / Azure Key Vault
- [ ] `.env` files listed in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Secret rotation policy defined

### Access Control
- [ ] Least-privilege principle applied (minimal IAM/RBAC permissions)
- [ ] MFA enabled for all human users
- [ ] Service accounts have no interactive login
- [ ] API keys scoped to minimum required permissions

### Network Security
- [ ] Network policies / security groups restrict traffic to necessary ports only
- [ ] All external endpoints use TLS 1.2+ (no HTTP for production)
- [ ] Internal service communication encrypted (mTLS where possible)
- [ ] Public-facing endpoints behind WAF / DDoS protection

### Audit & Monitoring
- [ ] All admin actions logged and retained for 90+ days
- [ ] Alerts configured for suspicious activity (failed logins, privilege escalation)
- [ ] Log forwarding to SIEM configured

### Patch Management
- [ ] Container base images pinned to specific digest (not `:latest`)
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Dependency update policy defined (Dependabot / Renovate)
